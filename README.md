# Streamlit Computer Vision

This repository contains a simple computer vision application to generate images from a prompt.

The front uses streamlit whereas the backend uses openjourney pretrained model pulled from huggingface repository. The two services communicate via RabbtiMQ.


## TODO:

* Use GPU on the backend to accelerate computation.
* Add some setup instructions or script to pull huggingface models.
